				<h2>Hello, my name is...</h2>
				<p>Julie Gauthier</p>
				<p>I'm an adjunct professor at Seidenberg. I live in Hebron, CT. I lived in NYC for 5 years when I went to Pace University for a BS in Computer Science. I spent two years working for Seidenberg Creative Labs, where I learned web development. Some of the older students mentored me, and I went on to be the lead developer for my junior year of college. I love doing hackathons, like AngelHack and Space Apps Challenge. I volunteer with FIRST Tech Challenge (I &hearts; Robots!). Adjuncts at Pace can take all of the classes that they want for free after working for a year, so I just finished my MS in Computer Science last semester. I'm a long distance runner, and a pirate in my spare time. My dog, Douglas, is my life. Look at his sweet little face!</p>

				<h2>My web development experience includes...</h2>
				<p>I spent the summer after my freshman year at Seidenberg, working with some of the older students on a few different projects. I spent a lot of time banging my head against the wall, because I couldn't figure things out. Once I finally did get some things figured out, I thought a lot about how I would teach it all to someone else so that it wouldn't be as arduous. After working with several excellent clients at Seidenberg Creative Labs on some website and some mobile app projects, I participated in the Product Development Project at Aalto University. The first year, I worked for a company called Wartsila to build an augmented reality system to improve the experience for cargo shipping captains. The second year that I participated in the program, I worked for Ray, Finland's gambling and casino organization, to come up with some new gaming concepts. These sorts of projects opened my eyes to the fact that not all tech is just about websites or apps or hardware, but about building systems that leverage a toolkit of hardware and code. My first internship was as a web developer for a company called Renthackr, which was all Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I looooove Ruby on Rails. I taught several web development workshops for college students, high school and middle school students, and even elementary school students throughout my time at Pace. I started a company called <a href="http://codapillar.com">Codapillar</a> (which is being rebranded and redeveloped in the coming months) and won some sweet awards. I took on another internship at web development agency <a href="http://domandtom.com">Dom & Tom</a> towards the end of senior year, and accepted a full-time position with them post-graduation. It was cool to work at an agency because I got to work with a lot of start-ups on their first draft of their software, devising the whole thing from the ground up. It was chaotic, but I got to try so many new languages and frameworks all of the time. Then in 2016, I started teaching at Pace, and have taught this class, Problem Solving with Lego Robotics, and CIS101.

				<h2>I like to teach this class because...</h2>
				<p>It's important that people have an understanding how web applications work in general. It's important to know how the data you're putting into websites gets handled, so that you can evaluate the risks you're taking when putting information into a website or app. Once you know how data gets passed around through code, it's pretty easy to build a useful web application. There's a LOT of jobs in web development, and they pay well. I also happen to think that it's a lot of fun, and super empowering to be able to build software that can help other people!</p>

				<h2>My plan for the future is to...</h2>
				<p>Pursue my PhD and become a professor. I'm applying to PhD programs this year. Being a professor is awesome, because you have control over what and how you teach, your students for the most part want to be learning, and you get to work on research that is interesting to you. My focus will most likely be in artificial intelligence. I also plan to get Codapillar launched ASAP, so that it can be used by students beginning to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
